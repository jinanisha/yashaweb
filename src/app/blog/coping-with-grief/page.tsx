            There are many ways to cope with grief in a healthy manner:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

          <p>
            Having a strong support system is crucial during the grieving process:

          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">Self-Care During Grief</h2>
          <p>
            Taking care of yourself is essential while grieving:

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
          <p>
            It's important to recognize when you might need additional support:

            <li>Persistent feelings of hopelessness</li>

          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>
            Grief is a deeply personal experience, and there's no "right" way to grieve. The goal isn't to "get over" your loss, but to learn to live with it in a way that allows you to move forward while honoring your feelings and memories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take that time. Be patient with yourself and allow the grieving process to unfold naturally.
