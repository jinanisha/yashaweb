            Harold Searles, a key figure in psychoanalysis, introduced the unsettling idea that individuals — especially those with psychotic structures — may unconsciously attempt to "drive the other person crazy." This isn't driven by conscious malice. Rather, it's an attempt to externalize inner fragmentation — to project unbearable confusion or incoherence into another person as a form of psychological survival.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the "other person" is a child living with a psychotic parent, this dynamic can have a long-lasting impact.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">What Happens to the Child?</h2>
          <p>
            Children in such environments often face a reality that feels inconsistent, unpredictable, or emotionally distorted. Their parent may oscillate between affection and paranoia, logic and delusion — often without explanation or acknowledgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, the child may begin to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Question their own perceptions ("Did that really happen?")</li>
            <li>Feel emotionally responsible for their parent's mental state</li>
            <li>Take on adult-like caregiving roles prematurely</li>
            <li>Experience chronic anxiety, confusion, and guilt</li>
            <li>Suppress their needs or emotions to avoid triggering instability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This emotional instability can shape their self-concept, relationships, and worldview in subtle but significant ways.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">The Long-Term Effects in Adulthood</h2>
          <p>
            These children may grow up to become adults who:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Struggle with emotional boundaries</li>
            <li>Feel responsible for others' well-being</li>
            <li>Are hypervigilant to others' moods and cues</li>
            <li>Experience self-doubt, especially in intimate relationships</li>
            <li>Carry an invisible burden of confusion, shame, or unprocessed grief</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Searles' concept helps explain why such individuals often feel "crazy" themselves — not because they are mentally ill, but because their reality was distorted by someone who projected their own psychotic experience into them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters in Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Unpacking this dynamic in therapy can be incredibly healing. It allows individuals to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Understand the origin of their confusion and self-doubt</li>
            <li>Separate their authentic thoughts from projected distortions</li>
            <li>Develop a stable sense of self</li>
            <li>Set boundaries that were never modeled in childhood</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not about blaming the parent — many psychotic parents love their children deeply. But it is about naming the emotional impact of being raised in an environment where reality itself was unstable.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>
            If you resonate with this experience — feeling like your sense of self was shaped in the shadow of a parent's psychological disorganization — therapy can help you make sense of it. Healing begins with recognizing that the chaos you internalized wasn't yours to carry.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold">
            Your experience matters. It's not "too subtle" to count. Reclaiming your inner clarity is possible — and you don't have to do it alone.
